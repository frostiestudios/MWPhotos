### How I got Started

My Story begins when I found my Nikon D40 at a thrift store in Huntington Beach.  The camera body was listed as **junk** and was on sale for **$15**. I bought it right away alonfg with a $15 NIKKOR lens.  My camera bag was a $10 polaroid bag for a 1996 Spectra System (Which i also own but do not have the film for). Ever since buying my camera i have enjoyed taking pictures of things and places I enjoy.  Photography is a Genuine Passion, and I started MWP to share my passion.
